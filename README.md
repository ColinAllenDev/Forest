# Forest - a simple forest generator

I wanted to create a map editor inspired by old school tools like Hammer Editor.

# Features

## Map Editor/Painter
The map editor allows users to load in game assets and paint them throughout a map.

### // TODO:
- 1. Create Obj Loader
-- 1a. Get textures working
-- 1b. Allow to switch between different material settings
